LIST OF BUGS (in order of high -> low priority)
-----------------------------------------------
* classes:
 > Contour
 	* popShape uses worldpts... is this an issue?

* curationTool:
 > need some way to see if its working or not
 	idea: set button to flat when clicked, unflat when series loaded

* excelTool:
 > problems when writing over excel workbook with same name

* mergeTool:
 > loading large series into mergeTool takes INCREDIBLY LONG TIME
 > overwriting doesnt work with sections
 > quickMerge functions dont update GUI (just contours)
 > overlapping contours are written out using the first (left) series stuff (border, fill, etc.)
