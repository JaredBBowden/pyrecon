-----------------------------------------------
* classes:
 > Contour
 	* popShape uses worldpts... is this an issue?

 	idea: set button to flat when clicked, unflat when series loaded

* excelTool:
 > problems when writing over excel workbook with same name

* mergeTool:
 > loading large series into mergeTool takes INCREDIBLY LONG TIME
 	> MergeSection.checkConflicts() takes long time -- CONTOURS!!!
 > overwriting doesnt work with sections
 > overlapping contours are written out using the first (left) series stuff (border, fill, etc.)
